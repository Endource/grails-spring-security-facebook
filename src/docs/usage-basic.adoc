=== Example app

You can take a look at [Example Application|https://github.com/splix/grails-facebook-authentication-example], it's very
basic app, that have only one page, with 'Facebook Connect' button. Just clone it, put your FB App credentials, and play with it.

==== Add Facebook Authentication into your existing application

===== Initial plugin config

====== Domain Class

Create domain class for your facebook user:
----
class FacebookUser {
  Long uid
  String accessToken
  Date accessTokenExpires

  static belongsTo = [user: User] //connected to main Spring Security domain

  static constraints = {
    uid unique: true
  }
}
----

At `Config.groovy` setup full name (including package name, if used) of just created Facebook user domain, like:

----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.domain.classname='FacebookUser'
----

====== Add FB App credentials

You should create a Facebook App and copy App ID and Secret:

!create_app.png!

into @Config.groovy@:
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.appId=12345678900000
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.secret=76c2279743c99da3715e3d00f29a1234
----

PS it's just example, you should use your own `appId` and `secret`.

====== Add Facebook Connect button

There is special taglib (@<facebookAuth:@) that can be used at your view (any GSP page) to add Facebook Connect button.

Following code displays connect button for not authorized user, or show a welcome message to logged in user:
----
<sec:ifNotGranted roles="ROLE_USER">
  <facebookAuth:connect />
</sec:ifNotGranted>
<sec:ifAllGranted roles="ROLE_USER">
  Welcome <sec:username/>! (<g:link uri="/j_spring_security_logout">Logout</g:link>)
</sec:ifAllGranted>
----

===== Run

That's it! Run your application, and test that everything is working.

----
grails run-app
