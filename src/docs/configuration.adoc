== Configuration

=== Basic Configuration

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that you have installed and configured spring-security-core plugin before this step.
====

Most default configuration will look like:

----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.domain.classname='<your FacebookUser domain>'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.secret = '<Facebook secret for your app>'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.facebook.appId = '<Facebooks's app ID>'
----

When you have valid configuration you can put Facebook Connect button in you GSP:
----
<facebookAuth:connect permissions="email,user_about_me"/>
----

You don't need to add anything else.
