==== How to get user full name and/or email?

Main goal of the plugin is to make authorization. All other usage of Facebook API should be done by
using additional library, http://www.springsource.org/spring-social[Spring Social] for example.

First of all: you need 'email' permission on connect `<facebookAuth:connect permissions="email"/>`

Add Spring Social lib into your classpath, by adding following dependencies into your `build.gradle`:

----
compile 'org.springframework.social:spring-social-facebook:2.0.3.RELEASE'
----

and then you can use Facebook API. For example you can fetch user email and full name on user creation step:

----
def facebook = new FacebookTemplate(token.accessToken.accessToken)
def fbProfile = facebook.userOperations().userProfile
String email = fbProfile.email
String name = fbProfile.name
----
